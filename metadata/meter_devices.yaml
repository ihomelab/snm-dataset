  description: >
    A sensor measures the magnetic field generated by the current to get the on or off state of the the appliance.
    The ADC value from the magnetic field sensor is provided in the dataset, as well as the calculated on-off state.
    The on-off state can be determined by applying a threshold value to the ADC data.
  sample_period: 5 # s
  max_sample_period: 9 # s
  measurements:
    - physical_quantity: state # via the magnetic field (value provided from ADC)
