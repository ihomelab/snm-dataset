description: >
  At 2018-11-01 the sensors 2 (dishwasher), 12 (tumble_dryer) and 13 (washing_machine) broke. 
  They have been replaced at 2018-12-14.
  The sensor [8, 9, 10] (electric_vehicle_1) did also break, but was not replaced. Because a second electric  
  vehicle charging stations was available.
  Stove and oven are connected to the same electrical submeter.
